\section{Black hole perturbation toolkit }

In this section a summery on \cite{PhysRevD.73.024027}  has been provided. 



\section{Analytic Black Hole Perturbation Approach to Gravitational Radiation}
 This is a huge paper \cite{Sasaki2003} a review on that also might requied  some refence from here and there

We discourage the use of inline figures (e.g. \texttt{wrapfigure}), as they may be
difficult to position if the page layout changes.

We suggest not to abbreviate: ``section'', ``appendix'', ``figure''
and ``table'', but ``eq.'' and ``ref.'' are welcome. Also, please do
not use \texttt{\textbackslash emph} or \texttt{\textbackslash it} for
latin abbreviaitons: i.e., et al., e.g., vs., etc.


\paragraph{Up to paragraphs.} We find that having more levels usually
reduces the clarity of the article. Also, we strongly discourage the
use of non-numbered sections (e.g.~\texttt{\textbackslash
  subsubsection*}).  Please also consider the use of
``\texttt{\textbackslash texorpdfstring\{\}\{\}}'' to avoid warnings
from the \texttt{hyperref} package when you have math in the section titles.



\appendix
\section{Some title}
Please always give a title also for appendices.





\acknowledgments

This is the most common positions for acknowledgments. A macro is
available to maintain the same layout and spelling of the heading.

\paragraph{Note added.} This is also a good position for notes added
after the paper has been written. c
